# Numbering Analysis Findings

## What We Discovered

We successfully analyzed the numbering information in the Word document and found the relationship between text content and numbering values.

### Key Findings

#### 1. **Numbering System Definition**
The document has a sophisticated numbering system defined in `word/numbering.xml`:

- **abstractNumId='1'** (used by **numId='10'**)
- **Level 0**: `%1.0` (decimal format) → "1.0", "2.0", etc.
- **Level 1**: `%1.%2` (decimalZero format) → "1.01", "1.02", "2.01", etc.
- **Level 2**: `%3.` (upperLetter format) → "A.", "B.", "C.", etc.
- **Level 3**: `%4.` (decimal format) → "1.", "2.", "3.", etc.
- **Level 4**: `%5.` (lowerLetter format) → "a.", "b.", "c.", etc.
- **Level 5**: `%6.` (lowerRoman format) → "i.", "ii.", "iii.", etc.

#### 2. **BWA-SUBSECTION1 Analysis**
- **Text**: "BWA-SUBSECTION1"
- **Style**: "LEVEL 2 - JE"
- **Expected Level**: 1 (based on style name)
- **Expected Numbering Pattern**: `%1.%2` (decimalZero)
- **Expected Output**: "1.01" for the first subsection

#### 3. **The Key Discovery**
**BWA-SUBSECTION1 does NOT have numbering applied in Word!**

Only the deeper levels have numbering applied:
- BWA-SubItem1: numbering_id=10, level=4
- BWA-SubItem2: numbering_id=10, level=4
- BWA-SubList1: numbering_id=10, level=5
- BWA-SubList2: numbering_id=10, level=5

#### 4. **What This Means**
The "1.01" numbering that should appear with "BWA-SUBSECTION1" is:
- **NOT** stored in the visible text
- **NOT** applied through Word's numbering system
- **NOT** present in this document

The numbering system is **defined but not fully applied**.

### Technical Details

#### Numbering XML Structure
```xml
<w:abstractNum w:abstractNumId="1">
  <w:lvl w:ilvl="1">
    <w:numFmt w:val="decimalZero"/>
    <w:lvlText w:val="%1.%2"/>
  </w:lvl>
</w:abstractNum>
```

#### Document Structure
- **numId="10"** references **abstractNumId="1"**
- Paragraphs with **numbering_id=10** follow the numbering pattern
- **BWA-SUBSECTION1** has **style="LEVEL 2 - JE"** but **no numbering applied**

### Implications

1. **Missing Numbering**: The document has broken or incomplete numbering
2. **Style vs. Numbering**: Styles are applied but numbering is not
3. **Hidden Structure**: The numbering system exists but isn't being used
4. **Manual vs. Automatic**: Numbering may have been applied manually or removed

### Next Steps

This analysis reveals that:
1. **Word's numbering system is defined** but not applied to all content
2. **BWA-SUBSECTION1 should show "1.01"** but doesn't have numbering
3. **The numbering patterns are clear** and can be used for analysis
4. **Document structure is inconsistent** - some levels have numbering, others don't

This provides a foundation for:
- **Detecting broken numbering**
- **Understanding expected numbering patterns**
- **Identifying missing level assignments**
- **Repairing document structure**

### Conclusion

We successfully found where Word hides the numbering information and discovered that the "1.01" numbering for "BWA-SUBSECTION1" is **missing from the document**. The numbering system is defined but not applied, indicating a broken or incomplete document structure.
