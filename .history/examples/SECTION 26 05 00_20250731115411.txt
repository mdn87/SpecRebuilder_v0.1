	B.	When this project is finished, the work under this Division shall be complete in every respect, completely integrated with all the existing systems, and left in perfect operating condition.  The electrical service to the building shall not be interrupted at any time without written coordination of the building's Owner.  All existing electrical equipment removed during the project shall be removed from the site after inspection of the building's Owner.  All existing electrical systems required to be operating at the project's completion or required to remain in use during the project shall be reconnected, replaced, rerouted or otherwise made to fit with proper workmanship techniques and left in safe working order.
	C.	Connect new work to existing work in a neat and workmanlike manner.  Where an existing structure must be cut or existing utilities interfere, such obstructions shall be bypassed, removed, replaced or relocated, patched and repaired.  Work disturbed or damaged shall be replaced or repaired to its prior condition.
	D.	Prior to the start of any demolition or construction, secure the services of a qualified, EPA Certified asbestos abatement agency to check the existing insulation, etc. for asbestos.
